============================================
ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- No logger is used in the current codebase. 
  ➔ **NEXT:** Add global error handling and logging (e.g., using Python's logging module or loguru) in main.py and core API routes for better debugging and monitoring.
- Frontend (Streamlit) and backend (FastAPI) structure is complete, and real API calls are now in use for all main features.
- Session history is implemented in the frontend and working correctly.
- Code formatting and syntax highlighting are handled by `utils/code_formatter.py` and working as expected.
- All configuration is managed via `config/settings.py` and `.env`.
- Testing covers backend API structure but needs expanded test coverage.
  ➔ **NEXT:** Implement unit tests for models, services, and error handling.

**CRITICAL PATH FOR MAY 11-12:**
1. **Expand and finalize test suite** - Add unit tests for all components and ensure >90% coverage.
2. **Add error handling and logging** - Implement comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application.
3. **Prepare for deployment** - Create Docker configuration, deployment scripts, and documentation.
4. **Polish UI and UX** - Complete any remaining UI enhancements and ensure consistent styling.

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (May 11 Evening):**
1. Expand backend and frontend test coverage
2. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
3. Prepare for deployment with Docker configuration
4. Finalize documentation and polish UI
