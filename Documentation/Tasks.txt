============================================  
DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:

- Each day should end with a working, committed version  
- Prioritize features that build upon existing infrastructure  
- Start each day with testing tasks to ensure quality  
- End each day with documentation updates  

============================================  
ADDITIONAL NOTES:  
- Deadline: June 10th, 2025  
- Focus on quality and completeness of features  
- Consider technical dependencies when prioritizing implementation  
- Ensure comprehensive testing for all new features  
- Document API changes and new endpoints thoroughly  
- Use feature flags for experimental or incomplete features
