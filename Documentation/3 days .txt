## üõ°Ô∏è RISK MITIGATION

**If you get stuck:**
- Don't add new features, fix existing ones
- Simple is better than broken
- A working basic app beats a broken advanced one

**Minimum Viable Demo:**
- Code explanation that works flawlessly
- Code generation with good prompts
- Clean, professional UI
- One unique feature (multi-model or quiz)

**Emergency Backup Plan (if behind):**
- Just focus on making explanation + generation perfect
- Add good documentation and examples
- That alone is still impressive

## üí° FINAL ADVICE

**You've got a solid foundation - don't panic!** 

Focus on:
1. **Quality over quantity** - make what you have amazing
2. **User experience** - smooth, intuitive, no bugs
3. **One standout feature** - something unique that showcases AI
4. **Great presentation** - good README, live demo, clear value prop

**Remember:** A polished basic app that works perfectly is infinitely better than a feature-rich app that's buggy. You can always add features later, but you can't fix a bad first impression.

**Go crush it! üöÄ**
