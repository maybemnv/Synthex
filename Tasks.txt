============================================
ADDITIONAL NOTES:

PRIORITIZATION:
- Focus on core explanation and generation functionality first
- Learning mode and advanced features can be simplified if time is short

CONTINGENCY PLAN:
- If running behind schedule, simplify learning mode and advanced UI
- Use simpler models if performance is an issue
- Focus on UX and reliability over stretch features

STRETCH GOALS (if time permits):
- User accounts and progress tracking
- Code execution and testing
- Export functionality for explanations
- Multiple theme options
- Mobile-optimized view
